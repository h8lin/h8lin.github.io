	<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
	<p>
	<h2>Q: What is the difference between <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> CSS length units?</h2>
	<p>CSS length units help define the size of different elements in your code. When you want to add an object to your
	code with a specific size, you will use length units to determine how big that object will be.
	</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p><textarea cols="100"
			rows="4"> <textarea cols="100" rows="5"> In this tag, “cols” determines the horizontal length that text area element will be, and “rows” determines the vertical length.</textarea>
		</textarea></p>
	<p>Absolute CSS length units are units that do not depend on anything else in your code to determine the size.
		Comparably, one foot is equivalent to twelve inches in the same way that one cm as a CSS length unit is equal to
		37.8px and 25.2/64 in.</p>
	<p>Relative CSS length units then are relative to another element of the code. If you want to change the size of
		something by comparing it to the size of something else, you might use relative length units. For font size, em
		determines font size relative to the font size of the original font-size element.</p>
	<p><textarea cols="100" rows="5"> <div>This tag represents a division in the page elements. Anything can be contained within it, including style, structure, and written content.</div>
<div class="header">This addition creates meaning to this specific div tag, clarifying that it is a header.</div>
        </textarea>
	</p>
	<h2>Absolute CSS Length Unit: px</h2>
	<p>px is the abbreviation for pixels, which are determined by the rough size that they would look on that specific
		device. This is a common unit that translates well from device to device because it is implied that 1px will be
		defined differently on a device with high resolution than on a low-resolution device. The px unit is relative to
		device size and resolution, but not to the specific code.
	</p>
	<h2>Relative CSS Length Units: %, vmin, vmax</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p><textarea cols="100" rows="15"> When we add: 
	li {
  font-size: 95%;
}
Then when creating this list:
	<li>

	<p>This line will have the largest font size of the list.</p> 

		<p>This line will have font that is 95% as large as the previous line.</p> 

			<p>Just like this line will have its font at 95% of the font from the line above it, and so on.</p>
	</li>
</textarea></p>
