    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Q: What is the difference between <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> CSS length units?</h2>
    CSS length units help define the size of different elements in your code. When you want to add an object to your code with a specific size, you will use length units to determine how big that object will be.  </p>
	<p>For example:</p>
    <p><textarea cols="100" rows="4"> <textarea cols="100" rows="5"> In this tag, “cols” determines the horizontal length that text area element will be, and “rows” determines the vertical length.</textarea>  
    </textarea></p>
    <p>Absolute CSS length units are units that do not depend on anything else in your code to determine the size. Comparably, one foot is equivalent to twelve inches in the same way that one cm as a CSS length unit is equal to 37.8px and 25.2/64 in.</p>
	<p>Relative CSS length units then are relative to another element of the code. If you want to change the size of something by comparing it to the size of something else, you might use relative length units. For font size, em determines font size relative to the font size of the original font-size element.</p>
    <p><textarea cols="100" rows="5"> <div>This tag represents a division in the page elements. Anything can be contained within it, including style, structure, and written content.</div>
<div class="header">This addition creates meaning to this specific div tag, clarifying that it is a header.</div>
        </textarea>
    </p>
    <p>TLDR- semantic tags tell you what they will contain, non-semantic tags depend on the text within them to
        determine what they will contain.</p>
    <h2>Q: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
    <p>One benefit is being more clear and concise. Using the same kind of tag to do multiple different things can make
        your code harder to understand and more difficult to search through for errors. This also applies with
        transferring your code to different browsers, between different coders, and within different contexts. Semantic
        tags are more versatile.
    </p>
    <p>Another benefit is better accessibility. Content that cannot be accessed by everyone is content that will not be
        viewed by as many people. </p>
