        <h2>
            How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?
        </h2>

        <p>
            CSS media queries take information from a device, like screen orientation or media type, and use breakpoints in your
            CSS
            code to make changes to design elements in response to that information. Once you add a media query breakpoint, like device orientation, you can then specify a design element that will apply when the device meets that condition.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example:
        </p>

        <p>
            <textarea cols="100" rows="15">
            To specify a design element based on minimum device width of 640px, the breakpoint would be @media (min-width: 640px) { /*CSS CODE FOR DESIGN ELEMENT*/}
            </textarea>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is useful because your website design will have more compatabilty across more device types and sizes.
