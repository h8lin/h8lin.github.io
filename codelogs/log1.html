	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <p><h2>Q: What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
        Semantic tags are clear about what is contained within them, such as:
        <textarea> 
        <footer>This tag clearly defines the content as being a page footer.</footer>
        <section>This tag groups the content within it, defining page sections like chapters, links, and definition lists. </section>
         </textarea>
        Non-semantic tags suggest nothing about what can be contained within them, but they provide style and structure for the page layout. For example:
        <textarea>
        <div>This tag represents a division in the page elements. Anything can be contained within it, including style, structure, and written content.</div>
        <div class="header">This addition creates meaning to this specific div tag, clarifying that it is a header.</div>

        </textarea>
        TLDR- semantic tags tell you what they will contain, non-semantic tags depend on the text within them to determine what they will contain. 
        <h2>Q: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
        <textarea>A:</textarea>
