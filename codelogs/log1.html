    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Q: What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
    Semantic tags are clear about what is contained within them, such as:</p>
    <p><textarea cols="100" rows="4"><footer>This tag clearly defines the content as being a page footer.</footer>
<section>This tag groups the content within it, defining page sections like chapters, links, and definition lists. </section>
         </textarea>
    </p>
    <p>Non-semantic tags suggest nothing about what can be contained within them, but they provide style and structure
        for
        the page layout. For example:</p>
    <p><textarea cols="100" rows="5"> <div>This tag represents a division in the page elements. Anything can be contained within it, including style, structure, and written content.</div>
<div class="header">This addition creates meaning to this specific div tag, clarifying that it is a header.</div>
        </textarea>
    </p>
    <p>TLDR- semantic tags tell you what they will contain, non-semantic tags depend on the text within them to
        determine what they will contain.</p>
    <h2>Q: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
    <p>One benefit is being more clear and concise. Using the same kind of tag to do multiple different things can make
        your code harder to understand and more difficult to search through for errors. This also applies with
        transferring your code to different browsers, between different coders, and within different contexts. Semantic
        tags are more versatile.
    </p>
    <p>Another benefit is better accessibility. Content that cannot be accessed by everyone is content that will not be
        viewed by as many people. </p>
