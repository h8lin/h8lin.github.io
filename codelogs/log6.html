    <h3><span>Pages Referenced</span></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>W3Schools: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp">CSS Styling Images</a></li>
        <li>MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Images">CSS Images</a></li>

    <h3><span>How is information presented differently on these sites?</span></h3>
    <p><span>The main difference between each of these webpages is the specific properties that they provide information
            about. There are numerous ways that you can stylize a photo using CSS, so each webpage chooses a few
            different options for users. Each page also has their own way of displaying the information, using text-area
            boxes, example images, and/or browser output examples. </span></p>

    <p>For example, the W3Schools page shows how to use properties like border-radius for rounding image edges,
        div.polaroid to create a Polaroid type frame on the image, size
        limits for scaling images, the opacity property, and image hover/text options. Each property described has an
        example of how that property looks when applied to an image. The page includes text-area boxes with examples of
        how the CSS would look, and demonstrations of the resulting image style.</p>
    <p>The MDN page provides a list of properties and functions to reference when styling images, like
        image-orientation, image-rendering, and linear-gradient(). Each function or property has a link to a further in
        depth page, and there are a few links to data types and guide pages.</p>
    <p>The article written by Temani Afif in CSS-TRICKS shows users how to create several more detailed borders. These
        include a corner only frame, a double line frame, frames with padding and lines, as well as several frame
        effects for when hovering over the image. This page includes text-area boxes to show the HTML and CSS used in
        the demonstrations, as well as the result for each style described.</p>
    <p>The Programiz page is similar to the W3Schools page, with a few different properties described using text-area
        boxes. This page also includes an example of what the browser output will look like, showing a bit more of the
        interactive elements of each property as they appear on page. There are also more options for responsive images
        on this page, describing how to define maximums on the image dimensions, adding transparency, adding background
        images, creating image cards, adding text overlay, utilizing the object-fit property to size the image, filters,
        and more. </p>
    <h3><span>Preferences for Code Reference Pages</span></h3>
    <h3>Best Features</h3>
    <p>The features that are most useful for me when viewing code reference pages are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An example of what the code will look like, such as a text area box or an interactive demonstration.</li>
        <li>A visual of the image style that the style options will create, bonus points for the examples that are
            interactive.</li>
        <li>A brief description of why the specific properties create the output.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Favorite Webpage Setup</h3>
    <p>The simplicity of the W3Schools page is particularly useful for properties that I feel are less involed, such as
        maximum dimensions. I appreciate the visual example that goes alongside the example code, and the information is
        presented simply without overly describing the function of that property.</p>
    <p>If I am looking to create more in-depth features on a webpage, I feel that the CSS-TRICKS and Programiz pages are
        more of what I am looking for. They are especially useful because of the more interactive features, and the
        descriptions of both the properties and functions that create the final output. These two pages stand out as
        particularly useful, and will likely be pages that I refer back to in the future. </p>
