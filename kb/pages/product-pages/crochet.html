            You might be surprised to hear that crochet is one of the only yarn-based crafts that cannot be replicated
            by machine. We have knitting machines, tufting machines, embroidery machines, and more, but still crochet
            remains machine-less. Since it requires a human hand, human innovation and creativity has always been a huge
            factor in which styles are popular for crochet designs. One place that we see that connection is with
            crocheted toys. Somewhat recently, we have seen a rise in plush toy collecting as adults. As a result,
            crocheted stuffed animals and amigurumi have become popular as a project for more than just baby showers.
            Another common use for crochet is creating garments. Crocheters can create anything they come up with, or
            follow any number of patterns for tops, cardigans, sweaters, dresses, shorts, socks, pants, and even
            swimsuits. Since fashion trends usually have a bit of a cyclical nature, styles and patterns from the 70’s
            might be just as popular today as they were back then. Starting from the 70’s, we will look at some of the
            most popular crochet styles over time.

        <h2>Fashion in the 70's-80's</h2>

            For people somewhat familiar with crochet, one of the foundational techniques to learn is the granny square.
            Granny squares make an easy building block for creating garments without having as much complicated stitch
            counting–a thorn in many crafters’ sides–and it is performed in a round (a technique where your crochet
            stitches continue on all sides of the project, where other techniques work on one side at a time, extending
            horizontally or vertically). In the 70’s and 80’s some popular granny square designs included shawls,
            overalls, and dresses, using the squares as building blocks for the finished garment. The more artistic role
            of crochet in garments of the 70’s and 80’s meant using the garment as a canvas, creating artwork akin to
            paintings. While palettes in the 70’s tended to lean towards more muted colors, the inspiration for many
            color palettes and designs in the 80’s were kaleidoscopes, tapestries, and the bright neons common in pop
            culture at the time. The 70’s and 80’s trends showed two distinct usages for the granny square, making it a
            staple in crochet designs then, and still now.
