        <p>
            You might be surprised to hear that crochet is one of the only yarn-based crafts that cannot be replicated
            by machine. We have knitting machines, tufting machines, embroidery machines, and more, but still crochet
            remains machine-less. Since it requires a human hand, human innovation and creativity has always been a huge
            factor in which styles are popular for crochet designs. One place that we see that connection is with
            crocheted toys. Somewhat recently, we have seen a rise in plush toy collecting as adults. As a result,
            crocheted stuffed animals and amigurumi have become popular as a project for more than just baby showers.
            Another common use for crochet is creating garments. Crocheters can create anything they come up with, or
            follow any number of patterns for tops, cardigans, sweaters, dresses, shorts, socks, pants, and even
            swimsuits. Since fashion trends usually have a bit of a cyclical nature, styles and patterns from the 70’s
            might be just as popular today as they were back then. Starting from the 70’s, we will look at some of the
            most popular crochet styles over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Fashion in the 70's-80's</h2>
        <p>
            For people somewhat familiar with crochet, one of the foundational techniques to learn is the granny square.
            Granny squares make an easy building block for creating garments without having as much complicated stitch
            counting–a thorn in many crafters’ sides–and it is performed in a round (a technique where your crochet
            stitches continue on all sides of the project, where other techniques work on one side at a time, extending
            horizontally or vertically). In the 70’s and 80’s some popular granny square designs included shawls,
            overalls, and dresses, using the squares as building blocks for the finished garment. The more artistic role
            of crochet in garments of the 70’s and 80’s meant using the garment as a canvas, creating artwork akin to
            paintings. While palettes in the 70’s tended to lean towards more muted colors, the inspiration for many
            color palettes and designs in the 80’s were kaleidoscopes, tapestries, and the bright neons common in pop
            culture at the time. The 70’s and 80’s trends showed two distinct usages for the granny square, making it a
            staple in crochet designs then, and still now.
        </p>

        <h2>Fashion in the 90's-00's</h2>
        <p>
            The 90’s and early 2000’s are known for their distinct fashion choices, and crochet garments followed right
            alongside those trends. Crop tops, funky bucket hats, scrunchies, and even chokers were all popular to
            crochet in this time period. Of course, many of the designs were inspired by popular clothes, media, and
            products of the time, leading to even more neons, florals, and funky color combinations. As it got closer to
            the 2010’s, crocheting became more popular with communities forming online. This meant more yarn colors,
            fibers, weights, and textures to choose from, leaning further into creativity for yarn artists. This period
            of time tested boundaries, and broke through what was previously seen as the line between possible and
            impossible in crochet. New techniques popped up in crochet circles, more yarn was stocked on store shelves,
            and more tools were created to make the job easier. The early 2000’s helped pave the way for the existence
            of crochet clothing that we see today.
        </p>

        <h2>Fashion in the 10's and 20's</h2>
        <p>
            During this time period, we saw crochet popularity dip as the world became more automated and more crafting
            machines became available. We then saw crochet skyrocket when the world locked down to help control a
            worldwide pandemic. With the rules in place that required people to stay inside infinitely more often than
            we were used to, people needed more time consuming and mind stimulating hobbies. Many people turned to
            crochet, and with more eyes on the hobby and more free time to practice, crochet style and techniques have
            seen a really fun change.
            2010’s and 2020’s style pulls from all of the popular designs I mentioned in the previous years. Among the
            most popular are crop tops (especially for festivals), bucket hats (especially with fun designs), granny
            squares galore, cardigans, and still many more. While pulling from previous years, crocheters have made old
            styles their own. In the 2020’s it has become increasingly popular to consider reducing and reusing,
            especially with thrifting and upcycling. One popular style in the 2020’s is to upcycle an old garment with
            numerous new crochet additions. New sleeves, trims, and pockets meet repurposed waistbands, slips, and yarn
            to give old pieces an entirely new life. With the changes that we have already seen over these last 50 or so
            years, I cannot wait to see how crochet adapts over the next 50!
