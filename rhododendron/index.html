		<h3>
			Habitat
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Pacific Rhododendron is the Washington state flower. It earns one if its other names, Coast
			Rhododendron,
			because of its proximity to the Washington and Oregon coasts, although it grows all the way from British
			Columbia to California, west of the Cascades. The plant prefers damp soil, although it can
			tolerate drier soil, and it will usually bloom mid-to-late spring, starting around late April.

		<h3>Physical Features</h3>
		<p>
			This plant ranges from about three to about twenty feet tall, described as shrub to small tree in size. The
			flowers can be seen in
			many shades of pink, from pale pink to a deeper rose nearing violet. They are fluted in shape with a flatter
			top, and have five lobes instead of individual petals that spread out into a wavy star-like shape. It has 10
			stamen of varying lengths, and only the longest protrude from the center. The plant has an interesting
			characteristic of producing thick and leathery evergreen leaves that protect themselves from colder and
			drier
			weather by growing the hairs on the underside and by rolling inward.

		<h3>
			Cohabitants
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Pacific Rhododendron is found near evergreen trees like Western red cedar, Western hemlock, and Douglas
			fir,
			where it is considered an understory plant that thrives under the cover of the taller limbs of trees.
			Although
			both the leaves and flowers contain toxins that protect them from most wildlife foragers, deer and beaver
			may be
			seen eating the flowers and flowerbuds. Songbirds utilize the larger bushes for their nests, and the nectar
			attracts insects like bumblebees and swallowtail butterflies.
