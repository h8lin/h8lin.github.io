			<h3>
				Habitat
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Pacific Rhododendron is the Washington state flower. It earns one if its other names, Coast
				Rhododendron,
				because of its proximity to the Washington and Oregon coasts, although it grows all the way from
				British
				Columbia to California, west of the Cascades. The plant prefers damp soil, although it can
				tolerate drier soil, and it will usually bloom mid-to-late spring, starting around late April.

			<h3>Physical Features</h3>
			<p>
				This plant ranges from about three to about twenty feet tall, described as shrub to small tree
				in size.
				The
				flowers can be seen in
				many shades of pink, from pale pink to a deeper rose nearing violet. They are fluted in shape
				with a
				flatter
				top, and have five lobes instead of individual petals that spread out into a wavy star-like
				shape. It
				has 10
				stamen of varying lengths, and only the longest protrude from the center. The plant has an
				interesting
				characteristic of producing thick and leathery evergreen leaves that protect themselves from
				colder and
				drier
				weather by growing the hairs on the underside and by rolling inward.

			<h3>
				Cohabitants
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Pacific Rhododendron is found near evergreen trees like Western red cedar, Western hemlock,
				and
				Douglas
				fir,
				where it is considered an understory plant that thrives under the cover of the taller limbs of
				trees.
				Although
				both the leaves and flowers contain toxins that protect them from most wildlife foragers, deer
				and
				beaver
				may be
				seen eating the flowers and flowerbuds. Songbirds utilize the larger bushes for their nests, and
				the
				nectar
				attracts insects like bumblebees and swallowtail butterflies.
