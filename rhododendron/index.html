	<h3>
		Habitat
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Pacific Rhododendron is the Washington state flower. It earns one if its other names, Coast Rhododendron,
		because of its proximity to the Washington and Oregon coasts, although it grows all the way from British
		Columbia to California, west of the Cascades. The plant prefers damp soil, although it can
		tolerate drier soil, and it will usually bloom mid-to-late spring, starting around late April.
	</p> 
	<h3>Physical Features</h3>
	<p>
		This plant ranges from about three to about twenty feet tall, described as shrub to small tree in size. The flowers can be seen in
		many shades of pink, from pale pink to a deeper rose nearing violet. They are fluted in shape with a flatter
		top, and have five lobes instead of individual petals that spread out into a wavy star-like shape. It has 10
		stamen of varying lengths, and only the longest protrude from the center. The plant has an interesting
		characteristic of producing thick and leathery evergreen leaves that protect themselves from colder and drier
		weather by growing the hairs on the underside and by rolling inward.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Cohabitants
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Pacific Rhododendron is found near evergreen trees like Western red cedar, Western hemlock, and Douglas fir,
		where it is considered an understory plant that thrives under the cover of the taller limbs of trees. Although
		both the leaves and flowers contain toxins that protect them from most wildlife foragers, deer and beaver may be
		seen eating the flowers and flowerbuds. Songbirds utilize the larger bushes for their nests, and the nectar
		attracts insects like bumblebees and swallowtail butterflies.
