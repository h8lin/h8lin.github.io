        <h1>Greek Inspired Salad and Crispy Pita </h1>
        <img src="fave-recipe-image.jpg">
        <p>This is not a Greek salad, but it is as close as I can get while being fairly picky and with a lot of food sensitivities. This is my favorite because it is great for nights when I want dinner to be fresh but also warm--plus I also really love Greek food.</p>
