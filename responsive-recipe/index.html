    <div class="recipe-description">
      This is not a Greek salad, but it is as close as I can get while being fairly picky and with a lot of food
      sensitivities. This is my favorite because it is great for nights when I want dinner to be fresh but also
      warm--plus I also really love Greek food.

      <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt; whisk to blend
        evenly.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, beat butter on medium-high speed until creamy using an electric hand mixer, about 10 seconds.
        Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add melted, cooled chocolate and beat on medium
        speed until well combined. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing until each one is well incorporated. Then, beat
        on high speed for 10 seconds to whip the eggs and make the batter a bit fluffy. Add sour cream and vanilla and
        beat on high speed until the batter is voluminous, 20-30 seconds.</li>
      <li>With mixer on medium-low speed, add one-third of flour mixture. Once mostly blended, add half of the milk and
        beat until almost completely incorporated. Repeat this step by adding half of the remaining flour mixture
        followed by the rest of the milk. Do not beat more than 15 seconds between additions. Finally, add the last of
        the flour mixture and beat until well incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and then beat
        on medium-high speed for 5 seconds. Do not over-beat to ensure a tender crumb.</li>
      <li>Divide batter evenly among lined muffin cups filling them about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick
        inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 16-20 minutes. Transfer cakes to a wire rack to cool
        completely.</li>
